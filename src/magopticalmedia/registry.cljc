  "Pure-function domain logic for the magnetic/optical media
  plant-operations coordination actor -- equipment/batch
  verification, shipment-quantity recompute, product-type validation,
  substrate (disc/tape/card) thickness plausibility validation,
  defect-rate plausibility validation, and draft
  maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination record construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/magopticalmedia`-style capability library
  to wrap (verified: no such repo exists). The domain logic therefore
  lives here as pure functions, re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by
  `magopticalmedia.governor` -- the same 'ground truth, not self-report'
  discipline every sibling actor's own registry establishes (e.g.
  `elecequipmfg.registry/shipment-quantity-exceeded?` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2710`, and `consumerelec.registry` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2640`): never trust a proposal's own
  self-reported quantity/status when the inputs needed to recompute it
  independently are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real plant-operations system. It builds the DRAFT record
  a plant coordinator would keep (a scheduled maintenance window, a
  coordinated shipment), not the act of actuating coating/molding/
  stamping-line equipment or dispatching a real freight carrier, and
  never the act of issuing a content-replication licensing/source-
  identification authorization mark (this actor NEVER does any of
  those -- see README `What this actor does NOT do`).

  SCOPE: ISIC 2680 covers manufacture of magnetic and optical media --
  magnetic-tape coating lines (coating a substrate film with magnetic
  particles) and CD/DVD/Blu-ray-style optical-disc injection-molding
  and data-stamping lines (replicating a stamper's pit pattern into a
  polycarbonate substrate), producing blank and pre-recorded magnetic
  tape, magnetic-strip cards, and optical discs. This actor coordinates
  the back-office record-keeping around that plant (production-batch
  logging, maintenance scheduling, safety-concern flagging, shipment
  coordination) -- it never touches the coating/molding/stamping-line
  equipment directly, and it never stands in for the rights holder /
  licensing body that issues content-replication licensing or source-
  identification authorization marks (e.g. an IFPI Source
  Identification (SID) Code).")
